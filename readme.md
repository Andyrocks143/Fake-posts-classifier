# FakeFews
<hr />
### Summary
Candidate solution for Facebook's [fake news problem](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/solving-the-problem-of-fake-news) using machine learning and crowd-sourcing. Takes form of a Chrome extension. Developed in under 24 hours at 2017 [Crimson Code](http://hackathon.eecs.wsu.edu/) hackathon at Washington State University.

Some notes:
* Python secure server (with classifier and training data) lies in *./server*
* Chrome extension lies in *./client*
* Server, along with training data, is currently stored locally. Plans are to host these on external server soon.
* Chrome extension is not yet available on Chrome App Store - this is in the works!

### Example
Here's an example classification of fake news, as would appear in your Facebook feed:
